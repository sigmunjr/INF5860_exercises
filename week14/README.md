# Week 14 Recurrent neural networks

## Part 1
In this exercise you will try to build an RNN. Checkout the code in **rnn_vs_human.py**.
There you find the skeleton of a class for an RNN. Fill out the function **`__init__`**,
where you initialize your variables. In the function **`__call__`** you implement
your actual RNN.

If you want a real challange, try to upgrade your RNN to a GRU or a multilayer RNN.


## Part 2
Try to find some text data on the web. Replace the input from the keyboard with
the text chunks.
